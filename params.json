It is assumed there is a file geodatabase of that state \r\n     in the state subfolder.  Each file geodatabase follows a normal naming convention\r\n     including the state abbreviation and the month, day and year of the submission.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 phases in the submission:\r\nPhase 1\r\n  - the Check Submission which checks to see if the submission follows NBM business rules\r\n  - this script has been updated (7/6/12) to include issues SBI awardees have raised and \r\n\t  \tNTIA has agreed to.  For a complete list of updated see the update notes in this \r\n  \t\tdirectory.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 \r\n  - State Summary which creates the state summary file for each states submission\r\n  - Business Rules which enforces NBM business rules, and cleans any data not conforming \r\n\t\tto these rules\r\n  - Append FRQ which generates an appended unique list of FRN, DBA, and ProvName fields\r\n  - UniqueID which prepares and populates a unique ID Field\r\n\r\nPhase 3\r\n  - Data prep which performs the wireless block overlay, and the random point file \r\n  \t\tgeneration\r\n  - FRQFRN which generates a table of unique FRNs across the datasets\r\n  - Export which exports all the data out of the file geodatabsse into a standard \r\n  \t\tformat to be read into a database (Postgres)\r\n\r\nPhase 4\r\n  - Spatial Layers which geoprocesses the data out of the file geodatabase and into \r\n  \t\tcommon formats as shapefiles so it can be loaded into PostGres\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning the scripts\r\n- After loading your data into the Data Transfer Model, add a tbx file to ArcCatalog.   \r\n \t We strongly suggest using ArcCatalog over ArcMap for a number of reasons.  \r\n\r\n- With the .tbx file added to ArcToolbox, attach the associated script and run it.\r\n\r\n- You will need to check this script for any 'FAILED' printed results.  A FAILED result \r\n\tmeans there are unexpected values in your data submission.  You will need to locate \r\n\tthe values, fix the issues and  rerun the tool.\r\n\r\n- We would like you to submit the reciept file (the .txt file generated by the tool)\r\n\t with your submission.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n- PLEASE NOTE: THIS TOOL RUNS THE ESRI CHECK AND REPAIR GEOMETRY TOOLS.  THESE TOOLS \r\n\tMIGHT CHANGE RECORD NUMBERS, GEOMETRY AND/OR FEATURES ON YOUR DATA.  WE ARE RUNNING \r\n\tTHIS DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME OF NON-VALID GEOMETRIES SUBMITTED IN PAST SUBMISSION.  \r\n\tIT IS A BEST PRACTICE TO RUN THESE TOOLS INDIVIDUALLY ON SAMPLE DATA PRIOR TO \r\n\tRUNNING THE CHECKSUBMISSION TOOL SO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH GEOMETRY ISSUES CONTAINED \r\n\tIN YOUR SUBMISSION.\r\n\r\n- THESe TOOL GENERALLY REQUIRE AN ARCINFO LICENSE TO RUN.  \r\n\r\n- THIS TOOL WAS CREATED AND TESTED IN ARCGIS 10.0\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
