</ul><p>This repository contains the all the scripts used to initially process 
the National Broadband Map data submissions.</p>

<p>All submissions run on:</p>

<ul>
<li>ESRI ArcInfo software</li>
<li>the NBM Data Transfer Data Model (file geodatabase)</li>
<li>in a standard directory structure with subfolders for each two letter state
 abbreviation.  It is assumed there is a file geodatabase of that state 
 in the state subfolder.  Each file geodatabase follows a normal naming convention
 including the state abbreviation and the month, day and year of the submission.</li>
</ul><p>There are 4 phases in the submission:
Phase 1</p>

<ul>
<li>the Check Submission which checks to see if the submission follows NBM business rules</li>
<li>this script has been updated (7/6/12) to include issues SBI awardees have raised and 
    NTIA has agreed to.  For a complete list of updated see the update notes in this 
    directory.</li>
</ul><p>Phase 2 </p>

<ul>
<li>State Summary which creates the state summary file for each states submission</li>
<li>Business Rules which enforces NBM business rules, and cleans any data not conforming 
    to these rules</li>
<li>Append FRQ which generates an appended unique list of FRN, DBA, and ProvName fields</li>
<li>UniqueID which prepares and populates a unique ID Field</li>
</ul><p>Phase 3</p>

<ul>
<li>Data prep which performs the wireless block overlay, and the random point file 
    generation</li>
<li>FRQFRN which generates a table of unique FRNs across the datasets</li>
<li>Export which exports all the data out of the file geodatabsse into a standard 
    format to be read into a database (Postgres)</li>
</ul><p>Phase 4</p>

<ul>
<li>Spatial Layers which geoprocesses the data out of the file geodatabase and into 
    common formats as shapefiles so it can be loaded into PostGres</li>
</ul><p>Running the scripts</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After loading your data into the Data Transfer Model, add a tbx file to ArcCatalog.<br>
 We strongly suggest using ArcCatalog over ArcMap for a number of reasons.  </p></li>
<li><p>With the .tbx file added to ArcToolbox, attach the associated script and run it.</p></li>
<li><p>You will need to check this script for any 'FAILED' printed results.  A FAILED result 
means there are unexpected values in your data submission.  You will need to locate 
the values, fix the issues and  rerun the tool.</p></li>
<li><p>We would like you to submit the reciept file (the .txt file generated by the tool)
 with your submission.</p></li>
</ul><p>NOTES:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS TOOL RUNS THE ESRI CHECK AND REPAIR GEOMETRY TOOLS.  THESE TOOLS 
MIGHT CHANGE RECORD NUMBERS, GEOMETRY AND/OR FEATURES ON YOUR DATA.  WE ARE RUNNING 
THIS DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME OF NON-VALID GEOMETRIES SUBMITTED IN PAST SUBMISSION.<br>
IT IS A BEST PRACTICE TO RUN THESE TOOLS INDIVIDUALLY ON SAMPLE DATA PRIOR TO 
RUNNING THE CHECKSUBMISSION TOOL SO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH GEOMETRY ISSUES CONTAINED 
IN YOUR SUBMISSION.</p></li>
<li><p>THESe TOOL GENERALLY REQUIRE AN ARCINFO LICENSE TO RUN.  </p></li>
<li><p>THIS TOOL WAS CREATED AND TESTED IN ARCGIS 10.0</p></li>
